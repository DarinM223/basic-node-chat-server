Redis:

Variables:

login:{user-id} -> int - returns 1 if user id with user-id is logged in

TODO: make return a set of all userids currently login
that way it will be easy to test if in a set, remove from a set, and clear a set

TODO: make login keys expire after a certain period of time and get renewed if that user
gets used again

user:unread:{user-id} -> int - returns the number of unread messages

Subscriptions:

user:message:{user-id} - receives messages for a specific user with user-id
